			When asked by the Yoostar company to design a flash website that enabled users to take a look at the box contents of the Yoostar package - virtually, I created this little piece to show them how we could have more fun with the interface design by using circular navigation elements that would move and flip in order to rearrange themselves as primary and secondary navigation elements.</p>

    		<p class="responsibilitiesinner">I was responsible for the interaction design, user-interface design and the prototype itself. The prototype was built in Photoshop and then animated using Adobe After Effects. I also modeled the camera, tripod and all products shown in the video using Rhino - a NURBS modeling application.</p>
