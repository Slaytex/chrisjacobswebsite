			<p class="ipgcopy">This was one of the most interesting I had worked on in a while. Interpublic Group's Emerging Media Lab asked us to come up with a new way of interacting with a clothing store's product in a way that's seldom seen - using a projected interface either on glass or behind a mirror in a dressingroom. I had this fun idea of dressing a virtual mannequin - available to a shopper inside the store or outside the store. A window-shopper could interact with the interface using a special touch-sensitive film on the other side of the glass. <a href="http://youtu.be/HTd83AWaHvc">Watch the youtube video of this interface in action.</a></p>

			<p class="ipgsubcopy">I was responsible for the design, interaction, as well as the photography strategy. With the fantastic help of Marc Johnson, strategy and Khue Jacobs, photography, as well as our fantastic Flash team in Seattle, this interface took flight just in time for IPG's big meeting of brand strategy leaders and retail touch-point pioneers.<a class="hidden-phone hidden-tablet" href="http://work.wongdoody.com/ipg">You can see it in action here</a>. It's large and very vertical. Works best with a rotated monitor.</p>
